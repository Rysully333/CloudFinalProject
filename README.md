# CloudFinalProject

This project focuses on creating a dining hall web-application to allow students to monitor dining hall occupancies in real-time.

Login/Sign Up: Users can log in with site-credentials or with Google.

Dashboard: Users can see current dining hall occupanies and where their friends are currently dining.

Profile: Users can update their display name and profile picture if they choose. They can also see the email associated with the platform and when their account was created.

Friends: Users can search for other platform users by typing in their name or email. They can send friend requests to those users if they want to be friends and they can also see a list of their existing friends below in the "Friends" section.

Check In: This allows users to pick a dining hall and report their location. This updates our backend database and updates the Dashboard with the new occupancy. 

Logout: When users are done using the platform, they can logout.
